	Starting with 1 and spiralling anticlockwise in the following way, 
	a square spiral with side length 7 is formed.

	37 36 35 34 33 32 31
	38 17 16 15 14 13 30
	39 18  5  4  3 12 29
	40 19  6  1  2 11 28
	41 20  7  8  9 10 27
	42 21 22 23 24 25 26
	43 44 45 46 47 48 49

	It is interesting to note that the odd squares lie along the bottom right diagonal, 
	but what is more interesting is that 8 out of the 13 numbers lying along both 
	diagonals are prime; that is, a ratio of 8/13 â‰ˆ 62%.

	If one complete new layer is wrapped around the spiral above, a square spiral with 
	side length 9 will be formed. If this process is continued, what is the side length 
	of the square spiral for which the ratio of primes along both diagonals first falls below 10%?
